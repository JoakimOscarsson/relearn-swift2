Also, Invader's ability is an on-play ability, which is only resolved when it is played.

Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Scout, the condition is 'after this base is scored', this means that you can only activate it after its base is scored, 'its base' being the base it is currently on. Obviously, if Scout isn't in play, there's no 'this base' that the condition can refer to. So Scout is actually a Special card that can only be used when it is in play.\n Rule: A Special ability will describe how it can be used.\n Rule: Abilities that say 'Before/When/After this base scores' can only be activated if the card is on the scoring base, if the card is attached to a minion on the scoring base or if the card is the scoring base itself."

                            "answer": "After its base scores, Scout's ability is triggered during the step where the players can play/invoke after-scoring abilities. But, that's just when its controller can decide to activate it or not. If they choose to activate it, nothing happens for the moment. However, when the players move on to the step where the cards on the base are all discarded, that's when the Scout is placed into its owners hand instead of being discarded.\n Rule: During the Score Bases step where the cards are discarded, all the cards on the scored base are discarded simultaneously. That's when the cards with 'instead of the discard pile' are resolved."

                            "answer": "No. Even though the card also goes from a base to your hand, it says 'place', not 'return'. Entangled and Ship’s Engineer do not interact with cards that are 'placed'.\n Rule: Specific words are not synonymous no matter how similar they seem."

                            "answer": "It's Scout's controller who decides whether or not Scout's ability is activated. But, if they decide that it is, then it will be returned to its owner's hand, not theirs.\n Rule: 'You' on a minion, action or titan means the controller of the card.\n Rule: When a card that others can see goes to the hand, deck or discard pile, it goes to the one belonging to the card’s owner."

At that point, you will indeed need to draw two cards and discard down to 10 if you have more than 10. That's the only moment where you must discard down to 10. At any other time, you keep their hand of cards. So if the base scored during another player's turn, you keep your cards and will be able to play your next turn with more than ten cards.\n Rule: You wait until your Draw 2 Cards phase to discard down to 10; if your hand is bigger than 10 at other times of the game, that’s okay."

Note that if the minion is a monster or a treasure, it remains in play because monsters and treasures can't be affected by cards that refer to a card's owner. Also, note that you don't get a second extra minion for affecting a second minion, because Dancing King only copies the part that returns a minion and the extra minion part isn't changed by the number of affected minions.- If We are Family copies it, the minion it is on is considered as indirectly affected by the action and is returned to its owner's hand, regardless of whoever owns the minion that was directly affected by the action.

Note that if the minion is a monster or a treasure, it remains in play because monsters and treasures can't be affected by cards that refer to a card's owner.

This means if the War Raptor you play is the third on that base, it will be power 5 and will be safe from the Leprechaun's ability which tests the War Raptor's power after it becomes power 5.

In your scenario, you invoke Copycat's ability while it's out of play and then use it to play Copycat, which isn't possible because you can only copy an ability by first playing Copycat. A Copycat's ability cannot be used to play the Copycat itself because playing it is required to invoke its copy ability in the first place.\n Rule: An on-play ability happens when you play its card."

                            "answer": "Yes, you can play it. Shinobi's ability is limited to once per base scoring. Even though it's the same base, it's the second time that base is scored, so you can play another Shinobi there.\n Rule: Do exactly what the card says."

                            "answer": "'Special' does not mean the card can be played out of turn. 'Special' simply means that it's an ability that can be used when its condition is met. Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Ninja Acolyte, the condition is 'on your turn', which means that you can only activate it during your Play Cards phase, not at any other times. Furthermore, it mentions 'this base', which means the base Ninja Acolyte is currently on. Obviously, if Ninja Acolyte isn't in play, there's no 'this base' that the card can refer to. So Ninja Acolyte is actually a Special card that can only be used when it is in play\n Rule: A Special ability will describe how it can be used.\n Rule: On a card, 'this base' refers to the base where the card is. If the card is attached to a minion, it refers to the base where the minion is. And if the card is a base, it refers to the card itself."

                            "answer": "First of all, Ninja Acolyte needs to already be in play. Supposing you're its controller, on your turn, i.e. during your Play Cards phase (phase 2), you can activate Ninja Acolyte's ability at any moment of that phase. When you activate it, check if you have already played a minion or not during that Play Cards phase (minions played during the Start Turn phase don't count against Ninja Acolyte's ability):- If you have, then nothing happens.- If you haven't, then you can decide if you want to use its ability or not. If you do, then you must return Ninja Acolyte into its owner's hand. After doing that, whether Ninja Acolyte was actually returned or not, you get an extra minion play that you must play immediately or not at all.\n Rule: 'You' on a minion, action or titan means the controller of the card.\n Rule: 'On your turn' means 'during the Play Cards (phase 2) of each of your turns'.\n Rule: When a card that others can see goes to the hand, deck or discard pile, it goes to the one belonging to the card’s owner.\n Rule: Effects are resolved entirely.\n Rule: Extra cards gained by a Special ability must be played immediately or not at all."

                            "answer": "No. It doesn't say 'you may return this minion to your hand and you may play an extra minion on this base.' So, if you choose to do the 'you may', you then have to do all of it. The extra minion is actually optional though, but you do have to return Ninja Acolyte.\n Rule: 'You may do X and Y' means you either do both X and Y, or neither X nor Y.\n Rule: Extra cards are always optional."

Secondly, when you return the first Ninja Acolyte, you must play the extra minion you gained immediately or not at all. If you do, the second Ninja Acolyte can no longer be activated because you have already played a minion.\n Rule: Extra cards gained by a Special ability must be played immediately or not at all."

After choosing your minion(s), you get that many extra minion plays that you must play immediately or not at all before doing the rest of Disguise's ability (even if Disguise is played on your Play Cards phase). After doing that, whatever happened with your extra minion plays, you must do the following to the minion(s) that you chose at the beginning:- If it's a minion you own, it's returned to your hand.- If it's a minion owned by another player, it's returned to that player's hand.- If it's a minion that no one owns (e.g. a treasure, a monster), it's discarded into the appropriate discard pile.\n Rule: 'Your minion' means 'a minion that you control'.\n Rule: When a card that others can see goes to the hand, deck or discard pile, it goes to the one belonging to the card’s owner.\n Rule: Monsters and treasures go to their own discard pile when they leave play."

Note that you won't be able to play an additional extra minion for the returned Diva, because you've already chosen one or two minions and got exactly that many extra minion plays before you're able to copy the return effect. Also, note that merely choosing minions doesn't count as affecting them, so you can't copy that part.- If Dancing King copies it onto a minion (it can be itself), that minion is considered as indirectly affected by the action and is returned to its owner's hand, regardless of whoever owns the minion(s) that was(were) directly affected by the action. Note that if the minion is a monster or a treasure, it is discarded instead. This is a different answer compared to cards that refer to a minion's owner; this card never refers to the card's owner ('you' means 'the controller', who may not be the owner) and so the rule is that the treasure/monster is discarded. Also note that you won't be able to play an additional extra minion for the returned extra minion, because you've already chosen one or two minions and got exactly that many extra minion plays before you're able to copy the return effect. And note that merely choosing minions doesn't count as affecting them, so you can't copy that part. Finally, note that if you return two minions, Dancing King only triggers once and allows you to return only one additional minion, not one per affected minion.- If We are Family copies it, the minion it is on is considered as indirectly affected by the action and is returned to its owner's hand, regardless of whoever owns the minion(s) that was(were) directly affected by the action.

If I transfer it to one of my minions, e.g. with Tinx or Rules Lawyer (possible here, because transferring the action affects the action, not the minion!), I have control of it, so my minion is therefore protected until the start of my next turn, right? Or does the 'Play on one of your minions' prevent me from transferring it to my minions?",
                            "answer": "No, transferring an action doesn't make you its controller and transferring it to a different player's minion doesn't grant that player control of the action. The action's controller simply doesn't change. Also, you can transfer it to your minions; 'Play on one of your minions' is simply a restriction for when the action is played, and is no longer relevant once the action is in play and doesn't further restricts how the action can be transferred (because transferring is different than playing!) So, the player who played it still controls it, and therefore the action only addresses them and the ability must be interpreted from their point of view. So 'your turn' means 'their turn' and 'other players' means 'their opponents'. In summary, what you just did by transferring the action to your minion is make it unaffectable by any player that isn't the action's controller (so you included!) and the action will be destroyed at the start of the action's controller's next turn anyway.\n Rule: When you transfer an action, it doesn't change controller."

                            "answer": "- If you're asking about when Smoke Bomb is played, it doesn't interact with them at all, because Smoke Bomb says 'Play on one of your minions', which means that it is not a standard action.- If you're asking about when you copy an effect onto an opponent's minion with Smoke Bomb protecting it, then the minion isn't affected. Note that Smoke Bomb only protects against other player's actions, so if Smoke Bomb's controller plays a standard action, you can copy it with Dancing King and have it affect the minion with Smoke Bomb, bypassing its protection because the minion is considered as being affected by its own controller's action.- If you're asking about when an opponent's minion with Smoke Bomb protecting it is directly affected by your standard action and you want to copy that, then it's not possible because the minion isn't affected by your action and because no minion was affected, you can't copy the effect.- If you're asking about when an opponent's minion with Smoke Bomb protecting it is directly affected by that player's standard action and you want to copy that, then you can indeed copy it the same way.\n Rule: Definition of 'standard'.\n Rule: 'Can't' trumps 'can'."

Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Pirate King, the condition is 'before a base scores', which means that you can only activate it during the Score Bases phase of any turn, and more specifically during the step where before-scoring abilities can be used. Furthermore, it mentions that when activated, you may 'move' it. Moving involves a relocation from one base to another, so Pirate King must already be on a base.

If so, is it destroyed? If not, does it stop the rest of the ability if there were more to it?",
                            "answer": "Short answer: Yes, no and it depends. Firstly, you can indeed choose any of your minions as long as it fits the card's requirement (e.g. if Buccaneer is on R’lyeh, you can target it with R’lyeh's ability, but you can't if it was on another base, obviously), but you must choose one if you have any in play and if it's a mandatory ability (i.e. there's no 'you may'). Secondly, because it is targeted for destruction, Buccaneer's ability kicks in and immediately converts the destruction into a movement, so Buccaneer will not be destroyed, whether it can actually move or not. Lastly, you must finish resolving the card that was originally invoked. If the card was the kind of card that says 'Destroy a minion to do Y' or 'Destroy a minion. If you do, do Y', then the effect stated as 'Y' can't be done at all, simply because in the end Buccaneer isn't destroyed. If the card says something else, such as 'Destroy a minion. Do Y', 'Destroy a minion and do Y', etc., the destruction isn't a pre-requisite so you resolve the rest of the card's ability.\n Rule: The card you target may be immune to the effects of the ability you are performing, but it is still a valid target.\n Rule: Effects are resolved entirely.\n Rule: For cards in play that say 'If X/After X/When X/If X would happen/Before X, do Y', if X is done (or is about to be done), then you must do Y; not being able to do Y doesn't undo X.\n Rule: When a card says 'Do X to do Y' or 'You may do X to do Y', you need to completely do the effect stated as 'X' before you do the effect stated as 'Y'."

Destroying can only be done to a card in play, so Buccaneer must already be on a base. So Buccaneer is actually a Special card that can only be used when it is in play.\n Rule: A Special ability will describe how it can be used.\n Rule: Destroying lets you remove a card that's in play and put it in the discard pile."

Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of The Kraken's first Special, the condition is 'After a base scores where you had a minion while this card is not in play', so you can play it after the scoring of a base on any player's turn and where you have a minion. So The Kraken can indeed be played on any turn, but only after a base scores where you have a minion and after doing your best Liam Neeson impersonation. In the case of The Kraken's second Special, the condition is 'After this base scores', this means that you can only activate it after its base is scored, 'its base' being the base it is currently on. Obviously, if The Kraken isn't in play, there's no 'this base' that the condition can refer to. So that Special ability that can only be used when it is in play.\n Rule: A Special ability will describe how it can be used.\n Rule: Abilities that say 'Before/When/After this base scores' can only be activated if the card is on the scoring base, if the card is attached to a minion on the scoring base or if the card is the scoring base itself."

Is this correct? Additional mathematical/philosopical question: even if this is correct - if the order of cards in the deck is completely unknown, i.e. no cards have been placed under it and no cards on top of it have been revealed, may you waive shuffling the deck, for it wouldn´t really change the deck´s state (card order remains completely unknown)?",

Unlike Sleep Spores, which is applied immediately, Hatchling's ability is a mandatory ability that's activated after you're done playing your minion and resolving its ability. But, Leprechaun's ability is also a mandatory ability that's activated after you're done playing your minion. According to the rules, it's the current player who decides the order in which these two mandatory abilities are activated. If Hatchling is activated before Leprechaun, your minion's power will be lowered to 4 and it becomes vulnerable to Leprechaun. However, if Leprechaun is activated before Hatchling, the minion survives Leprechaun's destruction and has its power lowered by 1.\n Rule: The current player decides the order of events that are supposed to happen simultaneously.\n Rule: When a card says 'After X, do Y', you need 'X' to happen and be resolved completely before you do the effect stated as 'Y'."

When you play Mimic, its ability is resolved before Leprechaun's ability, so Mimic becomes power 5 (or more, if there's a higher printed power in play!) and so the Leprechaun can't destroy it.\n Rule: An Ongoing ability only becomes active when the card is in play.\n Rule: When a card says 'After X, do Y', you need 'X' to happen and be resolved completely before you do the effect stated as 'Y'."

                        "answer": "From the What Were We Thinking? rulebook, playing a card with a talent and using the talent on the same turn does trigger cards that react to a 'card being played'. Indeed, the rulebook clarifies that if you play a card with a talent, and use the talent on the same turn to move one of your minions to Forgotten Horrors' base, it does trigger Forgotten Horrors (Reminder: 'Forgotten Horrors - 'Ongoing: After you play a minion here or play a card that moves your minions to here,...' So you could generalize this by saying that if Brownie triggers from another player playing a card that affects it, then Brownie also triggers from another player playing a card with a talent and using this talent on the same turn to affect Brownie. So, the answer would be yes, Brownie makes you discard a card if you use a talent, but only if the talent is used on the same turn as the card with talent is played.A: UPDATE. Actually, The Bigger Geekier Box ruled that out. So, since talent is not activated when you play a card and since Brownie only activates from the card being played, the answer is no, you don't discard any card.\n Rule: When you play a card, an ability that starts with 'Talent:' is never resolved immediately."

                        "answer": "You've got the timing wrong. When Zapbot is played, you indeed have to resolve its ability first. But when you resolve abilities that give you extra cards, you don't play the card immediately. Instead, it is banked and you can later play the extra card. So, after your first Zapbot, you get an extra minion to play later, then Flame Trap is triggered, and destroys this Zapbot and itself. Because Flame Trap is now gone, you're free to play your extra minions there without them getting destroyed.A: UPDATE. The Bigger Geekier Box actually clarifies that extra cards can always be played immediately when you get them, so you can indeed chain minions before resolving Flame Trap. So Flame Trap triggers for each of the played minions. Then when it's finally time to resolve Flame Trap, you resolve it in the reverse order of the played minions, so from the most recently-played minion to the first one (the very first Zapbot here), see Shogun’s Palace's and So-So Corral's clarification. So the most-recently played minion is destroyed first as well as Flame Trap, but when you move on to the next minion, Flame Trap isn't in play anymore and its clarification states that the minion and Flame Trap must be on the same base for the minion to be destroyed. In summary, you only destroy the last-played minion along with Flame Trap, but the others remain in play.\n Rule: Check Flame Trap's clarification.\n Rule: Check So-So Corral's clarification."

If it's currently the Play Cards phase of the player who is playing Force of Wil, then no, because Mark of Sleep prohibits them from playing any action during that specific phase. At any other time, then it's perfectly legal. For example, if you play a second action after you play Mark of Sleep, then the player you targeted can indeed block you with Force of Wil. As long as it's not their next Play Cards phase, they are free to play Force of Wil on anyone.\n Rule: 'On your turn' means 'during the Play Cards (phase 2) of each of your turns'."

No. The Bigger Geekier Box rulebook clarifies that Zombie Lord's extra minions must be played immediately and so can't be saved (or 'banked') for later. Pay the Piper will force you to discard a card AFTER Zombie Lord's ability is resolved and so you don't have any more extra minion plays from it (all unspent extra minion plays gained from Zombie Lord are lost if they aren't used immediately).\n Rule: Extra cards that refer to a specific card must be played immediately or not at all."

What happens is, you play a Zapbot and bank an extra minion (that is not played immediately), then you must discard a card. If you play another Zapbot on the same base as your extra minion, you again bank an extra minion (that is not played immediately), then you must discard a card.A: UPDATE. Yes. The Bigger Geekier Box rulebook clarifies that extra card plays can always be played immediately when they are gained, even during phase 2. As such, you can indeed play all your Zapbots at once and then resolve Pay the Piper, which you can't pay because you won't have any cards to discard.\n Rule: Extra cards can always be played immediately."

                        "answer": "Yes, even though Pay the Piper is no longer in play, it was present when Mechanic is played, which is enough to trigger its ability. Then despite what happens to Pay the Piper, its ability is still resolved and you have to discard a card.A: UPDATE: Smash Up: Marvel now clarifies that an ability that was triggered can only be resolved if it's still in play or if it was removed from play by the triggering event itself. Here, Pay the Piper was triggered by the Mechanic, but what removed it was Ornate Dome, so you don't discard a card.\n Rule: For an ability to respond to a trigger, it also needs to be in play when the event finishes resolving, unless the trigger itself made the card go out of play."

                        "answer": "'Special' does not mean the card can be played out of turn. 'Special' simply means that it's an ability that can be used when its condition is met. Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Big Funny Giant, the condition is 'instead of your regular minion play', this means that you can only activate it when you have a regular minion play available, which is only on your turn and more specifically on your Play Cards phase. It cannot be played out of turn, because, outside of your own Play Cards phase, you don't have any regular minion plays to give up.\n Rule: A Special ability will describe how it can be used.\n Rule: “Instead of your regular minion play” means instead of the normal minion play allowed during your Play Cards phase; if used to play a non-minion card, no restriction on minion plays apply to that card play."

                        "answer": "No, such a restriction only applies when you play a minion. If you convert your regular minion play into a titan play, you're playing a titan, not a minion, so the restriction doesn't apply.\n Rule: “Instead of your regular minion play” means instead of the normal minion play allowed during your Play Cards phase; if used to play a non-minion card, no restriction on minion plays apply to that card play."

Any +1 power counter on it is removed.\n Rule: During the Score Bases step where the cards are discarded, all the cards on the scored base are discarded simultaneously.\n Rule: If, for whatever reasons, a titan must leave play, it's actually set aside near its owner's deck and any +1 power counters on it are removed."

If you have no minions and your total power there is 0, then you can't receive any VPs from the base. Now, if Big Funny Giant had any +1 power counters on it or gave you any total power (e.g. on Kaiju Island), then you would have at least 1 total power and be eligible. Otherwise, no.\n Rule: A player must have at least one minion or 1 total power on a base to be eligible to receive its VP reward."

However, if you forgot to activate Archmage's ability before you destroy it, you haven't banked any extra action and so its ability is lost. UPDATE. The Bigger Geekier Box simplifies it that you can play the extra action even if Archmage is destroyed on the turn it is played.\n Rule: Each 'on your turn' ability can be activated once on each of your turns.\n Rule: During your Play Cards phase, you can play extra minions and actions at any time or not at all."

If it's not the case when it's revealed, then the action is discarded without effect. If it's the case, then you can play it, e.g. before a base scores, you play Mass Enchantment with a Mole and an opponent reveals a 'before a base scores' action.\n Rule: If a Special must be played when its conditions don’t allow it, it is discarded instead."

Disenchant on the other hand can only be used to destroy an action that's currently attached to a minion or a base, which excludes Mass Enchantment. Also note that destroying a card doesn't necessarily undo whatever the card did, it's just no longer there. And if you're referring to how the card is named 'Disenchant' and should therefore work on cards with the word 'Enchantment' in their names, those are just the name of the cards and what the cards can actually do is described in their abilities--don't assume anything from the card names alone or how you think cards should work.\n Rule: Do exactly what the card says.\n Rule: Removing a card from play does not necessarily undo what it did."

Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Arcane Protector, the condition is 'After you play your fifth or higher card in a turn', so you can play it immediately after you play your fifth or higher card on any player's turn.

So if you have zero or only one card in hand, you have +0 power on Arcane Protector's base; if you have two or three cards in hand, you have +1 power on its base; if you have four or five cards in hand, you have +2 power on its base; if you have six or seven cards in hand, you have +3 power on its base; if you have eight or nine cards in hand, you have +4 power on its base; etc. Every two cards, you gain one more power.\n Rule: Do exactly what the card says."

Now, if Arcane Protector had any +1 power counters on it and/or gave you any total power (e.g. from its Ongoing ability or on Kaiju Island), then you would have at least 1 total power and be eligible.

Actually, the extra minions granted by Zombie Lord must all be played immediately or not at all.

For the first question, you can no longer play an extra minion granted by Zombie Lord on Captain Ahab's previous base, because you used up your extra minion play for that base for Captain Ahab.

Once you play one extra minion on a base where you had no minions, that base will no longer counts as a base where you (currently) have no minions (you have one there already after all) and so isn't eligible for Zombie Lord's ability anymore.[2]A: UPDATE. Actually, the extra minions granted by Zombie Lord must all be played immediately or not at all; they cannot be banked for later. For your scenario, this means that you can indeed copy Zombie Lord's ability, that's also when you determine on which base you can play the extra minions. That restriction is then set for the rest of that Copycat's resolution. Next, you can indeed immediately spend your first extra minion play to play a Copycat from the discard pile and copy Zombie Lord's ability. Similarly to the first Copycat, you now determine on which bases you can play the extra minion plays granted by the second Copycat. Continue resolving that second Copycat's ability by immediately playing its extra minions (or not, in which case those are lost). Once you're done, according to the Card Resolution Order, you must finish resolving cards in the middle of resolution. In that case, you haven't finished resolving your first Copycat's ability. You can now continue to play the extra minions granted by your first Copycat, even though the bases now have minions you control on them; that's because the bases where you can play the extra minions are determined when Zombie Lord's ability starts resolving, not while it is resolving.\n Rule: Extra cards that refer to a specific card must be played immediately or not at all."

Whether it can be used out of turn, activated straight from your hand/discard pile, or if it can only be used when it's already in play (essentially being a synonym of Ongoing), it entirely depends on the wording. In the case of Tenacious Z, the condition is 'during your turn', which already restricts its usage during your Play Cards phase, not at any other times. Furthermore, reading the rest of its ability indicates that it allows you to play it from the discard pile and only one Tenacious Z per turn.

                        "answer": "No. Discard piles are 'public knowledge', so you can check which cards are in any player's discard pile at any time. If you take a card out of the discard pile, players are supposed to know what card was taken out. So, you should reveal it. Otherwise, how are you supposed to prove that you didn't put an action instead of a minion or that the minions you took all have the same name?\n Rule: If you take a card out of the discard pile, show it to everyone."

At that point, you will indeed need to draw two cards and discard down to 10 if you have more than 10. That's the only moment where you must discard down to 10. At any other time, you keep your hand of cards.\n Rule: You wait until your Draw 2 Cards phase to discard down to 10; if your hand is bigger than 10 at other times of the game, that’s okay."

So 'other players' means 'their opponents'.\n Rule: A play-on-base action doesn't give an ability to the base that any player can use.\n Rule: 'You' on a minion, action or titan means the controller of the card."

Firstly, you destroy it (no problem here). Secondly, you may search your deck for a minion of power 3 or less (no problem here and it's optional). Thirdly, if you chose to search for a minion, you have to play it on Sprout's former base (problem: Overrun forbids it, so you can't play it and it is discarded without effect). Fourthly, you shuffle your deck (no problem here).\n Rule: Effects are resolved entirely.\n Rule: 'Can't' trumps 'can'.\n Rule: If conditions prohibit playing a chosen card, discard it instead."

                        "answer": "It's an Ongoing, so its effect lasts for as long as the card is in play. If it wasn't, its effect would only be active when you play it and immediately stop. The Ongoing part is here to remind you that it lasts for several turns, then it's destroyed after a complete round of turns.\n Rule: An Ongoing ability lasts for as long as the card is in play, and/or it triggers at some later time while in play."

                        "answer": "It doesn't interact with them at all, because Overrun says 'Play on a base', which means that it is not a standard action.\n Rule: Definition of 'standard'."

If you are granted the possibility to play any minion from your hand (either as your free minion, or as an extra minion), you can decide to play one from your discard pile instead of from your hand with this card.\n Rule: If there are no limits, there are no limits."

If I have several Snuggly Bears and I play my first minion of the turn, can I play all Snuggle Bears from my discard pile?",
                        "answer": "No. The ability of They're Coming to Get You can only be used once per turn, so only one minion can be played from your discard pile this way. This was confirmed by an official source [3] and was added to The Bigger Geekier Box rulebook as a general rule for all 'on your turn' abilities.\n Rule: Each 'on your turn' ability can be activated once on each of your turns."
